[The speed of quantum computing](https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/04/the-route-to-high-speed-quantum-computing-is-paved-with-error/)		#computerscience, #tech, #long

Quantum computing, if we manage to build customer grade machines, will be the transistor revolution of our time. Through the last years, companies got more serious about it and it's becoming more and more real, but even the simplest things, as **computing speed**, are it are an unknown. A good read giving insight to surprisingly mature world o quantum computing. 

[A look into F# 4.1](https://www.infoq.com/articles/FSharp-4.1)		#microsoft, #Fsharp

I won't lie. I like F#, the community and where the language is going and for me it is one of the best real-life functional languages. Additionally the 4.1 version doesn't disapoint. A short read.

[Spanner paper](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/45855.pdf)	#long, #google, #spanner, #databases

Spanner made headlines with the claims that it breaks the CAP theorem and is consistent and available in case of partition. This will be no suprise to noone that the truth is not that groundbreaking, but there is some ground to Google's claims. As with any papers a long and technical read, but if someone is interested in distributed systems a should read for sure. 

[Manager classification](http://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/my-notes-on-looking-for-software-engineering-manager-job/)	#not-tech, #carrier 

I don't remember when was the last time when I was saying that any times "yes" or "oh this is so true". A well written post for everyone thinking that there is only Visual Studio, drawing squares in Visio and Excel carrier paths to choose from.

[Deep learning with emojis](https://tech.instacart.com/deep-learning-with-emojis-not-math-660ba1ad6cdc)	#long, #machine-learning

An interesting article about hot to optimize the shoping route. Be warn for better understanding it assumes some knowledge of Kerras, but even without it a nice read. 

[Adrian Cockroft](http://highscalability.com/blog/2017/3/27/faster-networks-cheaper-messages-microservices-functions-edg.html)	#architecture, #cloud

Cockroft is talking how thanks to hardware improvements we will be moving towards lambda architecture. For me a must read -  maybe because I agree with it?

[Is the future of self-writing programs near?](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ByldLrqlx)
Personally, I don't think so, but this paper proves that for some trivial cases, it's starting to happen.

[Real-time facial reenactment.](http://www.graphics.stanford.edu/~niessner/thies2016face.html)
Will we see this stuff applied in media or movies soon? Maybe we're seeing it already but we don't know it? Conspiracy theory starts in: 3, 2, 1...

[Zoom in, enhance!](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-4201838/Google-reveals-photo-enhancement-tool-sharpen-snaps.html)
Finally, reality starts to catch up with CSI. Plus you can check how it works by yourself [here](https://github.com/alexjc/neural-enhance).

[Some nice features are coming along with .NET 4.7.](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/04/05/announcing-the-net-framework-4-7/)
Especially for High-DPI WinForms applications that are still alive and kicking.

[Codeplex is shutting down.](https:/blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/bharry/2017/03/31/shutting-down-codeplex/)
Nothing to see here, move along. But if you're in the 0.01% of developers still using it, you can migrate to GitHub. Or just forget about it and start fresh in GitHub.

[Is webassembly the beginning of the end of the javascript?](http://www.infoworld.com/article/3176681/web-development/webassembly-is-now-ready-for-browsers-to-use.html)
Unfortunately, I don't think so, but any effort to minimize the javascript usage is a good step.

[A gadget for the shy freelancers in co-working spaces.](http://gethushme.com/)
But if you're shy to talk in public, won't you be shy about putting this stuff on?
