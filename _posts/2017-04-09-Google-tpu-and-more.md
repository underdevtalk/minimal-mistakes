[Is the future of self-writing programs near?](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ByldLrqlx)
Personally, I don't think so, but this paper proves that for some trivial cases, it's starting to happen.

[Real-time facial reenactment.](http://www.graphics.stanford.edu/~niessner/thies2016face.html)
Will we see this stuff applied in media or movies soon? Maybe we're seeing it already but we don't know it? Conspiracy theory starts in: 3, 2, 1...

[Some nice features are coming along with .NET 4.7.](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/04/05/announcing-the-net-framework-4-7/)

[Is webassembly the beginning of the end of the javascript?](http://www.infoworld.com/article/3176681/web-development/webassembly-is-now-ready-for-browsers-to-use.html)
Unfortunately, I don't think so, but any effort to minimize the javascript usage is a good step.

[A gadget for the shy freelancers in co-working spaces.](http://gethushme.com/)
But if you're shy to talk in public, won't you be shy about putting this stuff on?
